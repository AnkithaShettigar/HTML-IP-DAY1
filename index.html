    <b><li>Difference between div and span</li></b> <br>

    <b><li>Difference between block and inline</li></b><br>
    Block:- This element always begins in a newline and it extends from left to right.It takes the full width available on the screen.Browser automatically add some spaces(margin) before and after the element. <br><br>Examples: div tag, h1 to h6 tag, p tag, ol tag, ul tag, table tag etc. <br><br>

    Strong tag should be used to indicate strong importance or original of the text. <br><br>
    Em tag is used to represent stress emphasis, like when you read a emphasised text in a different tone of voice. Both can be used together,wher it makes sense. <br><br>
    <b><li>What are attributes?</li></b><br>
    In HTML attributes are special keyword which provides additional information about the elements. Attributes should be written in the lowercase only because it is a case-sensitive.
